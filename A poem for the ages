A true piece of work by Nay'in Goya

Roses are red
Violets are red
Everything is red
I set the lawn on fire

Through the crackling sound of the flames,
I hear police sirens.
Time to flee the country.
Also I need money so I go to the bank.
Then I swap it out at currency exchange.
Then I go to another country.
Then I go to the bank to make an account and deposit some money to take advantage of their continuous interest rate.
I must be wise with my finances.
